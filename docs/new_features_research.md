# New Features Research and Planning

## 1. EMI Collection and Receipts

### Best Practices:
- **Timely Interaction:** Regular and timely interaction with clients is crucial for effective collections. (Source: enterslice.com)
- **Digitalization:** Digitalizing loan collections reduces operational costs, enhances borrower engagement, and improves recovery rates. (Source: blog.credgenics.com)
- **Multiple Channels:** Facilitate collections through multiple channels, including digital payments. (Source: m2pfintech.com)
- **Automated Reminders:** Implement automated reminders for EMI due dates. (Implied from digitalizing collections)
- **Instant Receipts:** Generate instant digital receipts upon payment. (Source: zoho.com/us/invoice/free-receipt-generator.html)
- **Data Accuracy:** Ensure accurate recording of payments and generation of receipts to avoid discrepancies. (Source: procol.io)

### Data Structures (Proposed additions/modifications):
- **Loan Object:**
    - `payments`: Array of objects, each representing an EMI payment.
        - `paymentId`: Unique ID for the payment.
        - `loanId`: Reference to the loan.
        - `emiNumber`: Which EMI installment this payment corresponds to.
        - `amountPaid`: Amount paid in this installment.
        - `paymentDate`: Date of payment.
        - `paymentMethod`: e.g., 'Cash', 'Digital Transfer', 'Bank Transfer'.
        - `receiptUrl`: URL to the generated digital receipt.
        - `collectedBy`: User ID of the agent who collected the payment.

### UI/UX Considerations:
- **EMI Collection Form:** A simple form within the Loan Details view to record payments. Fields: EMI Number, Amount Paid, Payment Date, Payment Method.
- **Receipt View:** A dedicated section within Loan Details or a separate page to view and download receipts. Receipts should be professional and include all relevant loan and payment details.
- **Payment History:** Display a clear payment history for each loan, showing paid vs. pending EMIs.

## 2. KYC Registration and Loan Application

### Best Practices:
- **Customer Identification Program (CIP):** Verify customer identity. (Source: legal.thomsonreuters.com)
- **Customer Due Diligence (CDD):** Assess customer risk. (Source: trulioo.com)
- **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):** For higher-risk customers. (Source: legal.thomsonreuters.com)
- **Digital Workflows:** Embed KYC controls into digital workflows for efficiency. (Source: au10tix.com)
- **Good Customer Experience:** KYC procedures should be streamlined to minimize friction for the user. (Source: surfly.com)
- **Comprehensive Data Collection:** Collect necessary personal, financial, and identification documents. (Implied from KYC requirements)

### Data Structures (Proposed additions/modifications):
- **Customer Object:**
    - `kycStatus`: e.g., 'Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected'.
    - `idProofType`: e.g., 'Aadhar', 'PAN', 'Passport'.
    - `idProofNumber`: ID number.
    - `idProofUrl`: URL to scanned ID document.
    - `addressProofType`: e.g., 'Utility Bill', 'Bank Statement'.
    - `addressProofUrl`: URL to scanned address proof.
    - `photoUrl`: URL to customer's photo (already exists, but emphasize for KYC).
    - `occupation`: Customer's occupation.
    - `income`: Customer's income details.

- **Loan Application Object (New):**
    - `applicationId`: Unique ID for the application.
    - `customerId`: Reference to the customer.
    - `applicationDate`: Date of application.
    - `requestedAmount`: Loan amount requested.
    - `requestedTenure`: Loan tenure requested.
    - `requestedPurpose`: Loan purpose requested.
    - `applicationStatus`: e.g., 'Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected'.
    - `documents`: Array of objects for supporting documents (e.g., bank statements, income proof).
        - `documentType`: e.g., 'Bank Statement', 'Salary Slip'.
        - `documentUrl`: URL to the document.

### UI/UX Considerations:
- **KYC Registration Form:** A multi-step form to collect personal details, contact information, and document uploads. Clear instructions for document requirements.
- **Loan Application Form:** A form for customers to apply for new loans, pre-filling customer details if KYC is complete. Allow document uploads.
- **Status Tracking:** Customers should be able to track their KYC and loan application status.

## 3. Loan Approvals and Loan Disbursal

### Best Practices:
- **Credit Committee:** For larger loans, a credit committee can approve to reduce risk. (Source: cdfifund.gov)
- **Streamlined Process:** Develop rapid and accurate loan approval and disbursal methods. (Source: econdataanalytics.com)
- **Creditworthiness Assessment:** Rigorously assess borrower's creditworthiness before disbursal. (Source: fastercapital.com)
- **Clear Communication:** Communicate disbursement schedules and repayment terms clearly. (Source: fundingo.com)
- **Digital Disbursal:** Utilize digital channels for disbursal for efficiency. (Implied from digital microfinance trends)

### Data Structures (Proposed additions/modifications):
- **Loan Application Object (Update):**
    - `approvedBy`: User ID of the approver.
    - `approvalDate`: Date of approval.
    - `disbursalDate`: Date of loan disbursal.
    - `disbursedAmount`: Actual amount disbursed (might differ from requested).
    - `disbursalMethod`: e.g., 'Bank Transfer', 'Cash'.

### UI/UX Considerations:
- **Loan Approvals Dashboard:** A dedicated section for managers/admins to view pending loan applications. Each application should have options to 'Approve' or 'Reject' with fields for comments/reasons.
- **Loan Disbursal Interface:** Once approved, an interface to record the disbursal details (date, amount, method). This could be integrated into the Loan Approvals section or a separate Disbursal module.

## 4. User Management

### Best Practices:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign permissions based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Loan Officer, Customer). (Source: ibm.com)
- **Centralized Management:** Centralized system for adding, editing, and deleting users. (Implied from user management systems)
- **Audit Trails:** Maintain logs of user activities for security and compliance. (Implied from best practices in financial institutions)
- **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies and potentially multi-factor authentication. (Implied from general security practices)

### Data Structures (Proposed additions/modifications):
- **User Object (New/Update existing authentication):**
    - `userId`: Unique ID.
    - `email`: User's email.
    - `passwordHash`: Hashed password.
    - `role`: e.g., 'Admin', 'Manager', 'Loan Officer'.
    - `fullName`: User's full name.
    - `phoneNumber`: User's phone number.
    - `status`: e.g., 'Active', 'Inactive'.

### UI/UX Considerations:
- **User Management Table:** A table listing all users with their roles and statuses. Options to 'Add New User', 'Edit User', 'Deactivate/Activate User'.
- **User Creation/Edit Form:** Form to create new users or modify existing ones, including role assignment.
- **Role Definitions:** Clearly defined roles with associated permissions.

## General UI/UX Considerations for all new features:
- **Consistent Design:** Maintain the existing design language and mobile responsiveness.
- **Clear Feedback:** Provide clear success/error messages for all actions.
- **Loading States:** Implement loading indicators for asynchronous operations.
- **Search and Filtering:** Where applicable, add search and filtering capabilities to lists and tables.
- **Pagination:** For large datasets, implement pagination.

This research will guide the implementation of the new features. I will now proceed with the implementation phase, starting with EMI Collection and Receipts.
